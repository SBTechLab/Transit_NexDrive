This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Cron Jobs

TransitOps includes background jobs (cron jobs) for automated processes.

### License Expiry Check
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/cron/license-check`

This endpoint checks all active drivers for impending driver's license expirations and sends warning emails.
- **Triggers**: Exactly at 30, 15, and 7 days prior to the `licenseExpiryDate`.
- **Idempotency**: Safely callable multiple times per day; emails will only be sent once per trigger window per driver.
- **Setup**: In a production environment, set up a cron job (using Vercel Cron, AWS EventBridge, etc.) to hit `https://your-domain.com/api/cron/license-check` at least once a day (e.g. at 08:00 AM UTC).
